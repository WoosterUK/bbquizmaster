# Blackboard Quiz Generator
## Overview
Blackboard Quiz Generator is a tool for generating multiple-answer questions formatted in a way that is suitable for import as question pools in Blackboard. Through the use of random parameters, it enables the user to create five hundred instances of a given question, providing students with an essentially randomised experience akin to a regular e-assessment tool such as Numbas or Moebius. Unlike those systems, Blackboard is not able to handle free-text input in a mathematically sophisticated way, and thus only pre-defined answers are available. Nevertheless, as a native tool for Blackboard it has certain advantages.
